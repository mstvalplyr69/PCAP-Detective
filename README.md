# PCAP-Detective
Script Outline - "PCAP Detective"

Purpose
The goal is to tag packets in a PCAP with a specific identifier (e.g., custom text or unique pattern) that will stand out during packet analysis. These tagged packets will help identify anomalies or intrusions.
Features:

   -  Interactive Setup: Allows input for the local/remote machine, network interface, and  
      target IP.
   -  Tagging Packets: Insert a unique, easily identifiable string in the packet data.
   -  Custom Length: Ensure packets are of a specific length to make them distinct.
   -  Packet Capture Analysis: Optionally, capture the traffic and analyze it with Wireshark 
      or tcpdump.  - 

The idea behind your script is interesting, as it aims to create easily identifiable packets in a capture (PCAP) for identifying potential anomalies or intruders. Let's refine and expand your script outline to ensure clarity and functionality.

Here’s how we can structure your script more clearly and logically:

    Packet Capture Analysis: Optionally, capture the traffic and analyze it with Wireshark or tcpdump.

Steps and Structure

    Start the Interactive Dialog
        Ask the user to select whether they are tagging packets for a local or remote machine.
        Collect the necessary information (IP addresses, interfaces, etc.).

    Setup Network Info
        Populate the list of network interfaces.
        Let the user input the IP address of the target machine.

    Define Custom Packet
        Define the specific length and content (loud text) to be added to the packets.
        Generate packets using scapy or another packet crafting tool.

    Capture the Packets
        Optionally, set up a packet capture to monitor traffic and identify the tagged packets.

    Output the Results
        Save the capture to a .pcap file.
        Optionally, display the capture in a readable format.
import scapy.all as scapy
import argparse
